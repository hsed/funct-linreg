# funct-linreg

## Description

An implementation of machine learing using a simple linear regression model and a single-layer neural network in F#.

## Instructions

This code was tested using VS Code on Windows and the .Net Core framework. It is expected to work on Linux and OS X but some additional software maybe required.

1. Install the .Net Core Framework
2. Clone this repo and run `dotnet run` in the root directory
3. Select an appropriate option for the plotting depending on your system, if a window doesn't pop-up due to lack of installed libraries just save the picture as png.
